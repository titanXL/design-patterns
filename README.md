# design-patterns

A collection of design patterns

- Singleton - We can use either a class to check if an instance has been instantiated or just export a new instance of the class that needs to be a singleton, which will be then cached by the module system.
- Prototype - When a repetion of actions is at hand, we can use this pattern and centrelize the repetetive actions. Implemented by copy the instance prototype and creating a new object from that prototype and finally copying all current class properties.
- Factory - Encaplustes everything we need to create a instance in one method.
- Builder - Break down the construction of a complex object into separate concerns.
- Adapter - Convert an interface of a class into another. Allows classes to work togheter that couldnt otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Offtopic: path normalization needed for windows machines.
