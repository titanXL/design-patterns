# design-patterns

A collection of design patterns

- Singleton - We can use either a class to check if an instance has been instantiated or just export a new instance of the class that needs to be a singleton, which will be then cached by the module system
- Prototype - When a repetion of actions is at hand, we can use this pattern and centrelize the repetetive actions. Implemented by copy the instance prototype and creating a new object from that prototype and finally copying all current class properties.
